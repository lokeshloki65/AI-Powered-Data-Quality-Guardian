# 🛡️ AI-Powered Data Quality Guardian

An AI-driven web platform that automatically detects, analyzes, and corrects data quality issues in business datasets using Gemini AI, ensuring clean, reliable, and decision-ready data.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**AI-Powered Data Quality Guardian** is a smart data quality management system designed to solve one of the biggest real-world problems in data-driven organizations — **poor data quality**.  
The platform uses **AI (Gemini API)** to automatically identify errors such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, and invalid formats, and corrects them with minimal human effort.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Businesses heavily rely on data for analytics, AI models, and decision-making.  
However, real-world datasets often contain:
- Missing or null values  
- Duplicate records  
- Incorrect formats  
- Inconsistent or unreliable information  

Manual data cleaning is slow, expensive, and error-prone.

## 💡 Solution

This project introduces an **AI-powered Data Quality Guardian** that:
- Automatically analyzes uploaded datasets  
- Detects data quality issues using AI  
- Auto-corrects errors intelligently  
- Provides before–after comparison and quality scores  
- Gives admins full control over data governance
