🛡️ AI-Powered Data Quality Guardian
🚀 Overview

AI-Powered Data Quality Guardian is an intelligent, AI-driven web application designed to automatically analyze, detect, correct, and monitor data quality issues in business datasets.
Using Gemini AI, the platform ensures datasets are clean, consistent, reliable, and ready for analytics or AI models with minimal human intervention.

🎯 Problem Statement

In real-world businesses, poor data quality (missing values, duplicates, inconsistencies, invalid formats) leads to:

Wrong business decisions

Inaccurate AI/ML model outputs

Financial and operational losses

Manual data cleaning is time-consuming and error-prone. This project solves the problem by automating data quality management using AI.

💡 Solution

The platform acts as a Data Quality Guardian, continuously monitoring datasets, identifying issues, auto-correcting errors using AI, and providing clear insights through dashboards and reports.
